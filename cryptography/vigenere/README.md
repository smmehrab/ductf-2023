# Vigenere

## Challenge

In our 4-1 course on cryptography, the first assignment challenged us to crack a Vigenere code without knowing the key. The method employed was the frequency test. While the assignment involved implementing the frequency test and Kasiski examination, it's noteworthy that there are numerous online tools available for similar tasks.
